    description:
      "So Cold is the third single by Chicago rockers The Midnight Calls.  In this 70s-influenced hard rocker, the band uses their brand of slide guitar to tell a twist on the traditional Blues tale of heartache caused by a woman. A cold temptress that leaves a trail of broken hearts in her path. Play it loud. The lyric video was conceptualized and filmed by UK media artist Mila Djokic-Randolph.",

    description:
      "“Coming Up Roses” is the second single from Chicago rockers The Midnight Calls. This guitar-driven hit to the gut reflects on the out-of-reach nature of fame and the American dream. A working class scream into deaf ears from a working class Rock & Roll band.",
