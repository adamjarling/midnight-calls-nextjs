      "“Since I’ve Been Thinking” is the fourth single by Chicago rockers, The Midnight Calls. In this track, the band digs into its Midwest roots producing a melodic Rock & Roll display reminiscent of classic Illinois bands like Cheap Trick, REO Speedwagon or Enuff Z’Nuff. Play it loud!  Filmed, edited, and directed by Michael DiGioia (https://www.mikedphoto.com)",

    description:
      "“So Cold” is the third single by Chicago rockers The Midnight Calls.  In this 70s-influenced hard rocker, the band uses their brand of slide guitar to tell a twist on the traditional Blues tale of heartache caused by a woman. A cold temptress that leaves a trail of broken hearts in her path. Play it loud. The lyric video was conceptualized and filmed by UK media artist Mila Djokic-Randolph.",
